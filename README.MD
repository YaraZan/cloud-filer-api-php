3. **Install dependencies via Composer:**

    Navigate to the project directory and run:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and define the necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection, JWT secret key).

5. **Start the local server:**

   Start your local server using XAMPP (or any other installed server) and open the browser.

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: PHP (vanilla)
- **Authorization**: JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Database**: MySQL (or other supported databases)
- **Package Manager**: Composer

---

### Key Features:

1. **JWT Authentication**:
   - `Access token` is used to access resources with a limited lifespan.
   - After expiration, the `access token` can be refreshed using a `refresh token`.

2. **Security**:
   - All user data is protected, with authentication and authorization implemented using modern methods.

3. **Repositories**:
   - **CloudFiler** uses **repositories** to manage database interactions. Repositories act as data managers for specific database tables.
   - Each repository represents a corresponding database table and can override parent class `DB` methods, providing flexibility and customization for business logic.
